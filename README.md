## Project Overview
This project analyzes the business operations of an airline company that operates a diverse fleet of aircraft, ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. The analysis aims to address profitability challenges caused by stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market.

## Business Problem
The company's profitability is under pressure due to various external factors. The primary focus is to find ways to increase the occupancy rate, which can help boost the average profit earned per seat.

## Main Challenges
1. Stricter environmental regulations
2. Higher flight taxes
3. Increased interest rates
4. Rising fuel prices
5. Tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs

## Objectives
1. Increase occupancy rate
2. Improve pricing strategy
3. Enhance customer experience

## Data Description
The dataset used in this analysis includes information on:
- Aircraft types and their seating capacity
- Ticket bookings and revenue over time
- Fare conditions (economy, comfort, business) for each aircraft
- Number of tickets sold and revenue generated per aircraft
- Occupancy rates for each aircraft



## Tools and Technologies
- Python for data analysis and visualization
- pandas for data manipulation
- matplotlib and seaborn for creating visualizations
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development and presentation


## Data Analysis
The project includes analysis of:
1. Aircraft capacity (planes with more than 100 seats)
2. Booking trends and revenue over time
3. Average fares for different aircraft and fare conditions
4. Total revenue, total tickets, and average revenue per ticket for each aircraft
5. Average occupancy rates per aircraft
6. Potential revenue increase with a 10% higher occupancy rate

## Key Findings
1. The number of tickets booked shows a gradual increase from June 22nd to July 7th, followed by a stable pattern with a noticeable peak.
2. Business class fares are consistently higher than economy class across all planes.
3. The aircraft with the highest total revenue (SU9) has the lowest prices for business and economy class.
4. The aircraft with the least total revenue (CN1) only offers economy class at very low prices.
5. Increasing occupancy rates by 10% shows potential for significant revenue growth.

## Recommendations
1. Revise pricing strategies for each aircraft, finding a balance between attractiveness and profitability.
2. Focus on increasing occupancy rates to maximize revenue and minimize costs associated with empty seats.
3. Optimize pricing tactics and operational factors to enhance occupancy rates and revenue while delivering better value and service to customers.
4. Balance the need for profit with the importance of providing high-quality service and maintaining safety standards.



## Future Work
1. Conduct a more detailed analysis of factors influencing occupancy rates, such as seasonality, route popularity, and competitor pricing.
2. Develop a predictive model for occupancy rates to help with dynamic pricing strategies.
3. Analyze the impact of customer satisfaction on repeat bookings and overall revenue.
4. Investigate the potential for new routes or adjustments to existing routes to maximize profitability.
5. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis of implementing environmentally friendly practices to address stricter regulations.
